  <!-- SECTION ONE -->
  <section id="problem">
    <h2>The Challenge Facing Small Businesses</h2>
    <p>
      Small businesses are facing increased pressure from rapid technological change
      and the expanding influence of large corporate platforms. Many owners feel
      uncertain about the future, relying on outdated systems that increase
      operational costs, reduce security, and limit competitiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As markets become less competitive, local businesses are pushed into a corner—
      not because of poor products or service, but because they lack modern tools.
      Fear, misinformation, and rising costs keep many from adopting technologies
      that could protect and strengthen them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates a shrinking free market where independent businesses struggle to
      remain competitive and sustainable. Technology, when properly adopted, can
      reverse this trend.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to help small businesses transition toward secure, reliable,
      and cost-effective open-source technologies. We guide companies in migrating
      to Linux, open-source applications, and streamlined operational workflows—
      all without disrupting day-to-day operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe a strong free market depends on empowered local businesses. By
      adopting transparent, community-driven technologies, business owners regain
      control, reduce expenses, improve cybersecurity, and eliminate fear of
      external dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through hands-on support, education, and practical implementation, we enable
      businesses to modernize confidently and position themselves for long-term
      success.
