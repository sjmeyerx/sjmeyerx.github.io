  <h2>The Challenge Facing Small Businesses</h2>
  <p>
    Small businesses are facing increased pressure from rapid technological change
    and the expanding influence of large corporate platforms. Many owners feel
    uncertain about the future, relying on outdated systems that increase
    operational costs, reduce security, and limit competitiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
    As markets become less competitive, local businesses are pushed into a corner—
    not because of poor products or service, but because they lack modern tools.
    Fear, misinformation, and rising costs keep many from adopting technologies
    that could protect and strengthen them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This creates a shrinking free market where independent businesses struggle to
    remain competitive and sustainable. Technology, when properly adopted, can
    reverse this trend.
